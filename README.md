PhantomStandards
================

Various standards definitions/guidelines from Team Phantom

None of these standards are standards defined by any particular group other than Team Phantom - they are simply standards we made because no other standard existed for what we were trying to do.  
  
If you know of any standard which fills the same requirements of any standard here please tell us by filing an issue.  
If you use or implement any of our standards in your software please tell us about it (opening up an issue is fine)!  
If you wold like to consider using one of our standards as a reference to create a standard defined by a standardization group please tell us (opening up an issue is fine).  

Reccomendations
===============
If you have any recommendations as to how you think we can improve a standard please tell us.

Documentation Errors, Fixes
===========================
Plese DO NOT simply file an issue. Fork the repo, implement the fix, submit a pull request.  
If you submit a fix please be sure to write your name/info in the "Credits" section at the end of the file.  
We appreciate your help and we'll reward you with stickers/coffee/etc. when appropriate ;) .
